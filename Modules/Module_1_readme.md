## Module making for SARS-CoV-2 B4B

The base for practical content for this course will be in Python notebooks (.ipynb)

These must be workable in the Google Colab platform - https://colab.research.google.com 

We have created an example notebook - 

## Lecture Videos to watch:

[Module 1: Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfovZnX0TvKtHq6Q4L5KdW332NCD4GbtU)

Please use this as a start base for your module. 

## How to begin Part 1:
NB- you must begin part 1 before part 2. 

To begin, go to https://colab.research.google.com/ 

Use of Colab is free. Note - There are limitations on the free version, but we will not reach these for our conversion purposes. 

On the Colab example home page, select "File", then "Open Notebook"

There is a Tab for "Github"; select that tab and paste 
```
https://github.com/WCSCourses/SARS-COV-2_B4B
```
into the search bar under "Enter a GitHub URL or search by organization or user" 

After a brief search, you will see
```
Modules/Module_1_Notebook_Part1and2_v1.ipynb
```
below "Path". Click on "Module_1_Notebook_Part1and2_v2.ipynb"

In order to run the cells, you will need to login with your Google account (it is free to make an account).

**NB - The one opened directly from git will not save unless the first notebook steps are followed!**

## How to begin Part 2:
NB- you must begin part 1 before part 2. We will be using the same notebook for part 1 and part 2.

Part 2 will require you to find your notebook and continue where you left off. 

By default, your Notebooks will save in a folder on My Drive of your Google Drive called "Colab Notebooks". 

Watch the videos for Part 2 in the playlist, and resume the notebook. NB - you will need to rerun the conda install cell.
