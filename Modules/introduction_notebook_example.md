## Introduction Notebook:

## How to begin: 

To begin, go to [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/ )

Use of Colab is free. Note - There are limitations on the free version, but we will not reach these for our purposes. 

On the Colab example home page, select "File", then "Open Notebook"

There is a Tab for "Github"; select that tab and paste 
```
https://github.com/WCSCourses/SARS-COV-2_B4B
```
into the search bar under "Enter a GitHub URL or search by organization or user" 

After a brief search, you will see
```
Modules/Introday_Notebook_SARSCOV2B4B.ipynb
```
below "Path". Click on "Introday_Notebook_SARSCOV2B4B.ipynb"

You will see the template notebook open.

In order to run the cells, you will need to login with your Google account (it is free to make an account).

**NB - The one opened directly from git will not save unless the first notebook steps are followed!**

The instructions that are in the template must be followed. 

This is to ensure you keep a copy of your own notebook, named with your own name so it can be submitted.
