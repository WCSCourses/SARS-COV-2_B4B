# SARS-COV-2_B4B
This is a repository for development of the SARS-CoV-2 Bioinformatics for Beginners Course

SARS-CoV-2 variant lineage identification is key to pandemic tracking and enabling public health response. This course is an introduction to bioinformatics by applying skills used in SARS-CoV-2 genomic data analysis. This will be a distributed classrooms style course run across Africa; Latin America and the Caribbean; and Asia. This model was developed by [H3ABioNet](https://www.h3abionet.org), see this [publication](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008640) for more info. 

## Course structure 
This course is making use of Google Colab - https://colab.research.google.com/, a free to use service.

Access to Colab is via a [Google Account](https://www.google.com/account/about/), which can be made for free.

## Programme
The programme will cover the following core topics:

Intro to Python Notebooks
Intro to Unix/Linux & running commands
Introduction to NGS Technologies employed in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing
Data quality control
Workflows for sequencing analysis
Pangolin for lineage identification
Exploring genomics data in a global context

## Learning Outcomes:

Apply command line tools for sequence data quality control
List file formats commonly used in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing
Use Pangolin to create viral lineages from sets of existing data
List key metadata that must be included when uploading sequences to online repositories
Describe broad principles in translation of analysis outputs to outbreak/epi/pandemic response
